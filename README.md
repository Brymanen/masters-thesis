# Master's thesis Python code and crawling results
The repository can be split into three main parts considering the crawling and scraping part. The folders [google_scholar](https://github.com/Brymanen/masters-thesis/tree/main/google_scholar), [core](https://github.com/Brymanen/masters-thesis/tree/main/core) and [acm](https://github.com/Brymanen/masters-thesis/tree/main/acm) contain the code for the web crawlers and web scrapers for [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/), [CORE](https://core.ac.uk/) and [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/). The files regarding the results of the crawling results are provided as well.
Additionally, the file [duplicate_checker.py](https://github.com/Brymanen/masters-thesis/blob/main/duplicate_checker.py) is provided to eliminate duplicates. The names of recorded documents are, however, recorded in [deleted_pdfs_record.json](https://github.com/Brymanen/masters-thesis/blob/main/deleted_pdfs_record.json) to enable the user to keep track of deleted files.
